#ModTrek

### Overview: 
ModTrek is a desktop application for managing a typical NUS Computer Science studentâ€™s modules and degree progression, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI). We envision the app to be convenient so that students can easily access and update their modules within presses of a keyboard.
