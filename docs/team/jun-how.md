### Project: MODTrek

ModTrek is a desktop application for managing a typical NUS Computer Science studentâ€™s modules and degree progression, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
The app is provides a convenient platform for students to easily access and update their modules within presses of a keyboard.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: to be added soon

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jun-how&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * **New feature**: Module filtering via Find Command
    * What it does: Find Command not only allows users to find a specific module, but it also allows users to filter the list of modules by module code prefix, credits, sem-year, grade and tag. Multiple filters are also allowed.
    * Justification: This feature offers added convenience by allowing users to filter and navigate between modules more easily to search for certain modules satisfying a condition.
    * Highlights: Implemented the filter function by enhancing the FindCommandParser, FindCommand classes and modifying the Predicate which forms the core of the function.

  * **Enhancement to existing feature**: Help Command
  * What it does: Help Command acts as a tool that reminds users of command formats whenever they forget and require aid.
  * Justification: The old help command merely links users to the software's user guide page, which does not help much. With this enhancement, users could simply call help for the relevant command that they require more information about, which offers an added convenience.
  * Highlights: Enhanced the HelpCommandParser and HelpCommand classes to apply help function for every command, including a general one.

  * **Enhancement to existing feature**: Delete Command
  * What it does:
